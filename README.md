## RATIONALE / [RAZONES](LEEME.md)

* Web-app for internal use: transcribe interviews made on fieldwork using the [Google Speech Recognition technology](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/demos/speech.html)
* Just for the sake of transcribe fieldwork interviews
* We do not collect any data during transcribing sessions: all the data is in the `local storage` of Google Chrome
